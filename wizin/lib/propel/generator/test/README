This directory contains scripts and unit test classes for testing a Propel
generator AND runtime environments.  In particular, the bookstore-test.php 
script is a good way to test whether everything is *basically* working.  You 
can run the bookstore test by performing a few simple tasks.

(Assumes a vanilla install of Propel)

(1) Use the default top-level build.properties file (copy/rename 
build.properties-sample to build.properties).  Built the SQL + OM using the
default bookstore build.properties and runtime-conf.xml:

$> cd /path/to/propel-generator
$> phing -f build-propel.xml
   ....
   
(2) Execute the insert-sql target to initialize the sqlite database using the 
SQL files that were built in previous step:

$> phing -f build-propel.xml insert-sql
 
(3) From the top-level directory (it's important where you are) run the 
bookstore-test.php script like this:

$> php -qC test/bookstore-test.php

That's it.  You should see a bunch of test descriptions and a return status.  
If you get an error about not being able to find a table, make sure that the 
insert-sql step (2) completed successfully, and also that you are using the 
default proeprty files which should be set to use a sqlite database.

Take a look at the bookstore-test.php script to see some examples of how to 
use generated Propel objects.
